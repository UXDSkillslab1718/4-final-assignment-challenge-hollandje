			<h1>About Me (1997)</h1>
			<p>My name is Julien Heesterman and I was born on the 16th of February 1997. I have always had a major interest in creating experiences for other people to enjoy and this has thus far lead me to work on small/big personal projects within the game development industry. I have lived my entire life in a small country in western Europe called The Netherlands. I had a normal childhood in which I went to school, played (video)games with friends and let my creative side go on a roll through both music and digital art.</p>
			<p>Digital art has been something that I have always enjoyed spending time on, but it really kickstarted in 2012 when I started creating fan-made dog tags for Battlefield 3. The overwhelming responds from the community and the developers over at EA DICE made me realize that I really enjoy creating digital things for others. Eventually this led to me getting a community reward in Battlefield 3 and even my first official developer title in the Battlefield 4 credits. After Battlefield I tried creating digital weapon skins and digital level environments for the game Counter-Strike Global Offensive published by Valve. At the time of writing I have had the oppertunity to see 5 of my designed weapon skins to be used in the official game.</p>
			<p>Aside from creating digital stuff I enjoy spending my time travelling around the world and practicing photography. I am currently enrolled in the User Experience Design undergraduate course at The Hague University of Applied Sciences in The Hague where I plan to graduate in medio 2021. </p>
